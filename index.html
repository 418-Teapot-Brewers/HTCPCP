		<p>This page returns HTTP status code 418 I'm a teapot.</p>
		<p>That's because this server is running HTCPCP/1.0, but it also happens to permanently be a teapot. Thus, the message body may be short and stout.</p>

		<p>Pinging this website with an HTCPCP client should mostly work, except for GET requests being treated as HTTP GET requests. For full compatibility, please use <a href=/teapot>this page</a>.
