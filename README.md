# HTCPCP
 A pure C HTTP and HTCPCP implementation
 
Having spent weeks - nay, fortnights - working tirelessly through the night with intense water sips, regular hmms and at least 5 beard strokes, we proudly present to you our favourite waste of space and electricity: one of the few remaining members of the 418 teapot community.

We hope that this may be seen by at least one person who can appreciate a meme that spiralled out of control as much as us... I mean, this started as a joke, but look where we are now:
a month down the line we're exhausted, JP's addicted to caffiene more than ever before and we've written hundreds of lines of code which will never even be seen (since our server is a teapot and, thus, most of the HTCPCP code will never run on it).

We at least think this was worth the time, and maybe you might think so too. If so we've done our job and sucsessfully passed on the lessons of meme appreciation to a new generation.
If you want any more info, a chat, or even a brew (not with this teapot though) then pop us an email at [418teapotbrewers@gmail.com](mailto:418teapotbrewers@gmail.com), or contact us through the various social media connected to our GitHub accounts.

Oh, one more thing: yes, this is an HTTP server. Don't use it as one. It's written in pure C and doesn't use config files, so it's a bit of a nightmare to set up and use. Much better alternatives exist. This was a fun project, not a sensible one, and we would strongly advise against using it for anything important.

Code inspired by (and partially nicked from) [saljs's implementation](https://github.com/saljs/htcpcp).
